# 2D-action "Fast-Boom!"
Lua and LÖVE framework. The main idea of the game is to lure the pursuers into a trap.
 The player must push the pursuing enemies into a moving trap while avoiding it themselves. A moving blue line is also present on the map, obstructing the movement of both the enemies and the player.

Future implementation:
● Modification of the trap movement algorithm from level to level.
● Changes to the shape and movement algorithm of the wall.
● Voronoi diagram for cave generation.
● Pixel art.
